# __VS Code: Titanic Data Science Tutorial__

### This repository was used from [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/data-science-tutorial) to connect vs code and python.  
&nbsp;

## __Prerequistites__
- __[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)__ - intuitive code editor.
- __[Python extension for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)__ - provides vs code support for python with intellisense etc. 
- __[Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)__ - minimal installer for conda, it handles library dependencies outside of Python and creates a virtual environment.

## __Remaining Steps__

1. ### Create a data science environment

    - Open a Anaconda command prompt and run `conda create -n myenv python=3.7 pandas jupyter seaborn scikit-learn keras tensorflow`.
    - Create VS Code workspace folder `folder_name`.
    - Open project folder in VS Code.
    - Select Python Interpreter by opening Command Palette under View. 
    - Choose the myenv Python 3.7.5 environment that you created using the Anaconda command prompt. 
    - Open blank Jupyter Notebook or create a ipynb file using the New File icon via the VS Code File Explorer. 
2. ### Download the data

    - Use the Titanic data from [OpenML.org](https://www.openml.org/d/40945), this was obtained from the Biostatistics department at Vanderbilt University.
    - Save the data in the `folder_name` that was created above. 
3. ### Train and evaluate model
4. ### Use deep learning model to increase accuracy
